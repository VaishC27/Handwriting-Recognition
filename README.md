Title: Handwritten Text Recognition with Noise Reduction (MATLAB)

Description:

This repository implements a basic handwriting text recognition system in MATLAB. It addresses noise reduction and performs character segmentation for further processing.

Features:

Reads an image containing handwritten text.
Converts the image to grayscale (if applicable).
Converts the image to binary using adaptive thresholding.
Applies morphological operations to remove small objects (noise).
Identifies connected components (potential characters).
Extracts individual characters based on bounding boxes.
Requirements:

MATLAB with the Image Processing Toolbox
Instructions:

Clone or download the repository.
Ensure you have MATLAB and the Image Processing Toolbox installed.
Replace "MicrosoftTeams-image (23).png" in the code with the path to your image containing handwritten text.
Run the handwriting_recognition.m script (or any other script name you choose).
Output:

The code will display the following figures:

Input Image with Noise: The original image.
Input Image without Noise: The binary image after noise reduction.
Extracted Characters: Individual character regions identified by bounding boxes.
